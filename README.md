# Digit Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks
Part of a Kaggle competition in which the task is to classify hand-written digits in images. I used convolutional neural networks in the task and was able to achieve 99% classification accuracy (the percentage of images you get correct). This was my first use of CNN.
